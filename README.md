# CoAPP
This is the repository for the Multicast team's project for the course II1305 at KTH.

The goal of the project is to implement the IETS's RFC for CoAP publish-subscribe as an API/library for general use alongside Californium, and then build a front-end client Android app to show live data published from a network of sensors through a broker to subscribed clients using the aforementioned API. 

This Android app is built to use of the aforementioned library on a mobile device. 

The project is commissioned by the KTH Network Systems Laboratory. You can read more about it here: https://www.kth.se/cos/research/nslab
